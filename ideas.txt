sometimes, in order to solve a problem, you have to cut out the pieces that contribute noise.  For me, thats often starting with a blank slate, because I don't know whats noise and what isn't.
Starting with a blank slate is only additative. Not subtractive.
Am I figuring out why I'm having such a hard time with frameworks?
